Hello everyone!
It's development board with STM32.
I designed this board using the KiCad PCB design course I purchased from Udemy.
I continue to learn important details in PCB design.
Thus, I have added a new PCB design application to my portfolio after Altium Designer, Snap EDA, and Proteus.
It has its pros and cons, but I needed to learn it as it is still actively used for industrial purposes.
